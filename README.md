# Network Monitoring Tool (Python)
Overview

This project is a simple Python-based network monitoring and analysis tool designed to process network event logs exported in CSV format.
It simulates real-world monitoring data (e.g. from NMS, syslog, or monitoring platforms) and focuses on analyzing network events such as link failures, recoveries, and incidents.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate:

practical Python usage,
data parsing and analysis,
basic network monitoring concepts.

Features

Parse network event data from CSV files
Track network events per device and interface
Count and classify incidents by severity
Prepare the foundation for downtime and availability analysis
